&lt;h2 id="monday">Monday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Monday, I was in remote classes, after which I completed the work &amp;ldquo;The Spigot algorithm in C++&amp;rdquo; for Tuesday on the subject of &amp;ldquo;Computer workshop&amp;rdquo;. I rested in the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Tuesday, I attended classes at the institute, after which I went home, and then went to the volleyball section, rested in the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Wednesday, I was in class at the institute, the first pair for me was next to the main building, and the second was in the building of my faculty. At home, I was creating a presentation on Thursday on the subject &amp;ldquo;Fundamentals of Russian Statehood&amp;rdquo; about the Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow. I rested in the evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Thursday, I attended classes at the institute, where I told a presentation that I was preparing, and on Wednesday I defended my Laboratory work on the subject of &amp;ldquo;Programming Technology&amp;rdquo;. I rested after the steam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="friday">Friday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before the institute, I was preparing for the &amp;ldquo;solution essay&amp;rdquo; for English, in which I later wrote it. After graduation, I rested and began to carry out the second stage of the implementation of an individual project for the &amp;ldquo;Operating Systems&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
