&lt;h2 id="monday">Monday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Monday, I took distance classes, then rested.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Tuesday I attended classes at the institute, there was a matanalysis test, after the institute I was preparing for the Wednesday test and did not rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Wednesday I attended classes at the institute, there was a test in mathematical logic. After college, I got ready for Thursday at home and had a rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Thursday, I attended classes at the institute, defended a laboratory paper on programming technology. After college, I got ready for Friday at home and had a rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="friday">Friday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Friday I attended classes at the institute, there was a test in German and a monologue in English. I had a rest after college.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saturday">Saturday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Saturday, I rested and prepared for the next difficult week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sunday">Sunday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I did the same thing on Sunday as I did on Saturday.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
