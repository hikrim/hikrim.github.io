&lt;p>On Monday, I took distance classes, then rested.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Tuesday I attended classes at the institute, there was a matanalysis test, after the institute I was preparing for the Wednesday test and did not rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Wednesday I attended classes at the institute, there was a test in mathematical logic. After college, I got ready for Thursday at home and had a rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thursday">Thursday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Thursday, I attended classes at the institute, defended a laboratory paper on programming technology. After college, I got ready for Friday at home and had a rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="friday">Friday&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On Friday I attended classes at the institute, there was a test in German and a monologue in English. I had a rest after college.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pointers are one of the most powerful but complex topics in C++. They allow you to work with memory directly, which makes the code more flexible and efficient. Let&amp;rsquo;s figure out how they work!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-what-is-a-pointer">🔹 What is a pointer?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A pointer is a variable that stores the &lt;strong>address of another variable&lt;/strong> in memory. He announces himself like this:&lt;br>
``cpp
int* ptr; // ptr is a pointer to the int type&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-gdscript3" data-lang="gdscript3">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1">### 🔹 How do I get the address of a variable? &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">Using&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">the&lt;/span> &lt;span class="s1">&amp;#39;&amp;amp;` operator: &lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="err">```&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">cpp&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="ne">int&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">num&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="mi">10&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="ne">int&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ptr&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">&amp;amp;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">num&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">//&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ptr&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">now&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">stores&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">the&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">address&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">of&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">num&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="-pointer-dereference">🔹 Pointer dereference&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To get the value at the address, use the &lt;code>*&lt;/code> operator.:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="n">cout&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">ptr&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="c1">// Outputs 10 (the value of num)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1">&lt;/span>&lt;span class="err">``&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="cp">### 🔹 Dynamic memory
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="cp">&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">Pointers&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">are&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">often&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">used&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">to&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">work&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">with&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">dynamic&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">memory&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">:&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="err">``&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">cpp&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="-nullptr-instead-of-null">🔹 nullptr instead of NULL&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In modern C++, it is better to use &lt;code>nullptr&lt;/code> for empty pointers.:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="kt">int&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ptr&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="k">nullptr&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">;&lt;/span> &lt;span class="c1">// The pointer does not refer to anything
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="-why-is-this-necessary">🔹 Why is this necessary?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Pointers are used for:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Works with dynamic structures (arrays, lists).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transfer big data to functions without copying.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Polymorphism (through pointers to base classes).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>, Advice:&lt;/strong> Always check the pointers for &lt;code>nullptr&lt;/code> before using!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>✅ Last week's post</title><link>https://hikrim.github.io/post/last-week-stage-5/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hikrim.github.io/post/last-week-stage-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Insanity is the exact repetition of the same action, over and over again, in the hope of a change.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Scientific programming is a powerful tool for solving complex problems in mathematics, physics, bioinformatics, Data Science and other fields. But which languages are best suited for such calculations?
📌 Top 5 languages for scientific calculations:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Python 🐍
Advantages: Simplicity, rich libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), machine learning support (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Cons: Not the fastest, but integration with C/Fortran solves the problem.
Julia ✨
Advantages: High speed (like C), convenient syntax (like Python), built-in support for parallel computing.
Cons: There are fewer ready-made solutions than Python.
R 📊
Pros: The best for statistics and data visualization (ggplot2, dplyr).
Cons: Slower than Python/Julia, specific syntax.
MATLAB ➕
Pros: Ready-made tools for engineers and mathematicians, excellent visualization.
Cons: Expensive license, slower than modern analogues.
Fortran &amp;amp; C/C++ ⚡
Positive: Maximum performance, used in HPC (supercomputers).
Cons: Complex syntax, long development time.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>, Which one should I choose?&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>For Data Science / ML → Python + Julia.
For mathematical modeling → Julia / MATLAB.
For high-performance computing → Fortran / C++.
For statistics → R.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item><item><title>✅ Creating a report</title><link>https://hikrim.github.io/post/report/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hikrim.github.io/post/report/</guid><description>&lt;p>** How to make a report correctly: instructions for laboratory and research**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing a report is an important part of any scientific or educational work. A properly designed document helps to clearly state the results and make them understandable to the examiners. Here are the main points worth paying attention to:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-report-structure">&lt;strong>1. Report structure&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>✔ &lt;strong>Title page&lt;/strong> – title of the work, full name of the author, teacher/supervisor, date.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>Table of Contents&lt;/strong> – indicating the pages.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>Introduction&lt;/strong> – purpose of the work, tasks, relevance.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>The theoretical part&lt;/strong> is a brief review of the literature, basic concepts.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>Methodology&lt;/strong> – description of methods, equipment, algorithms.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>Results&lt;/strong> – tables, graphs, calculations with explanations.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>Conclusions&lt;/strong> – a brief summary of the results, meeting the goals.&lt;br>
✔ &lt;strong>The list of references&lt;/strong> is designed according to GOST or university requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-text-formatting">&lt;strong>2. Text formatting&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>🔹 &lt;strong>Font&lt;/strong> – usually Times New Roman, 12-14 pt.&lt;br>
🔹 **The interval ** is 1.5 (for readability).&lt;br>
🔹 &lt;strong>The margins&lt;/strong> are standard (2-3 cm).&lt;br>
*&lt;strong>Page numbering&lt;/strong> is end–to-end, starting from the title page (but no number is placed on it).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-graphs-and-tables">&lt;strong>3. Graphs and tables&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>📊 &lt;strong>Signatures&lt;/strong> should be clear, with numbers (Fig. 1, Table 2).&lt;br>
📊 &lt;strong>Discussion&lt;/strong> – each graph/table needs to be commented in the text.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-checking-before-delivery">&lt;strong>4. Checking before delivery&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Spelling and punctuation (you can use services like Grammarly).&lt;br>
Compliance with the requirements of the training manual (if any).&lt;br>
Logical presentation – are all conclusions justified?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>✅ Last week's post</title><link>https://hikrim.github.io/post/last-week-stage-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hikrim.github.io/post/last-week-stage-4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Insanity is the exact repetition of the same action, over and over again, in the hope of a change.&lt;/p>
