      <description>&lt;p&gt;Insanity is the exact repetition of the same action, over and over again, in the hope of a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monday&#34;&gt;Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, I was at school, after which I completed the necessary tasks, and rested in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuesday&#34;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, I attended classes at the institute, after which I went home, and then went to the volleyball section, rested in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday&#34;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I was in class at the institute, the first pair for me was next to the main building, and the second was in the building of my faculty. I had a rest after college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thursday&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I attended classes at the institute, after which I rested and prepared assignments for Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;friday&#34;&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I attended language classes at the institute, after which I was at home doing laboratory work No. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturday&#34;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I took distance classes, after which I had a volleyball section at the institute, after which I rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunday&#34;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was like a day off for me, and I also completed lab work No. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
